				Good for the grid
			</h2>
			<p>
				Battery storage systems offer flexibility to our evolving energy landscape. From homes to large-scale
				utility installations, batteries help us
				maximize the grid's potential. They can extend the benefits of renewable projects, balance voltage on
				the grid, and act as backup power
				source. For the rural communities our members serve, where energy infrastructure may be more vulnerable
				or limited, battery storage is a key solution that ensures the lights stay on â€” both now and in the
				future.

						Storing renewable power
					</h2>
					<p>
						Without batteries, renewables are a use-it-or-lose-it source of
						power. For example, we can only generate solar energy while
						the sun is shining, and depending on energy usage,
						sometimes we cannot consume it all. With batteries we can
						store this extra power for a time when the sun is not out,
						including the hours after sunset when electricity demand is
						still high. Renewables like wind and solar are some of the
						lowest-cost methods to generate electricity, so storing it
						helps Tri-State control costs.

						Critical stability services
					</h2>
					<p>
						The electrical grid operates at a 60 Hz. To maintain that
						frequency, power generated needs to match power
						consumed. Fluctuations in this flow, such as voltage sags and
						surges, are usually caused by changes in demand, generation
						and weather. Because of their quick response speed, batteries
						can balance these fluctuations in real-time. This reduces the
						likelihood of widespread power outages and makes our
						system more reliable. </p>

						Filling the gap with batteries
					</h2>
					<p>
						When the demand for electricity is greater than the amount
						of available renewable power being generated, we can fill this
						gap with batteries that have been charged ahead of time.
						Batteries also make the grid more flexible and affordable.
						They can dispatch their power quickly, allowing us to avoid
						supplemental fuel costs or release stored energy to the grid
						during periods of high demand, low renewable generation, or
						extreme weather events to make sure that member systems
						have access to power around the clock.

						Supporting transmission
					</h2>
					<p>
						Electricity usage is growing and so is the demand for
						renewables, which means we need to build more generation
						sources. Transmission lines are necessary to move that power
						from where it's made to where it will be used. However,
						building new transmission lines is extremely expensive and
						can take years to plan and execute, especially in rural and
						mountainous areas. Large-scale battery storage helps relieve
						some of these challenges. By strategically placing batteries,
						we can delay or eliminate building new transmission lines
						while still maintaining reliability and avoiding construction
						costs.

				Increasing affordability
			</h2>
			<p>
				When energy demand is high, electricity providers must generate and deliver more power, which makes it
				more expensive. "Peak demand"
				is when the need for energy is at its highest and often when energy prices are at their most expensive.
				Batteries allow us to use stored
				energy and avoid the costs of turning on more resources to meet that demand.
