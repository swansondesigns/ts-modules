							What it means to be a member
						</h2>
						<p>
							Tri-State is an association of our members—utilities and businesses spread across
							Colorado,
							Nebraska, New Mexico and
							Wyoming. As a cooperative, we are member-owned, and our board of directors is is made up
							of
							these diverse not-forprofit
							electric cooperatives and public power districts. Our board members are also ranchers,
							farmers and business owners
							that live near the utilities they represent. Together they leverage this expertise to
							make
							governing decisions for
							Tri-State.


						</p>
						<p>
							With our members, we supply power and services that support the rural communities they
							serve. That is the cooperative
							difference—we answer to our neighbors, not shareholders.

							Power in numbers
						</h2>
						<p>
							Our association was formed to bring electricity to our members in the rural West when other
							power providers would not.
							Together we can capture economies of scale while sharing the costs and risks of supplying
							power to areas with few
							consumers, difficult terrain and a lot of ground to cover. Even today, some of our members
							serve as few as one
							connection
							per mile of distribution line.
						</p>
						<p>
							But whether they’re in the desert, mountains, rural towns or plains—all our members still
							need reliable, affordable,
							responsible power. By pooling resources, collectively buying and selling power and managing
							the backbone of
							infrastructure that transports that power, we can negotiate better prices and build more
							efficient facilities than
							individual
							distribution cooperatives could on their own. This results in lower cost, more reliable
							electricity for our members.
