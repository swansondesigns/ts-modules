						Energy Investments
					</h2>

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">New ERA</h3>
					<p>
						Tri-State was recently awarded $2.5 billion in financing through the U.S. Department of
						Agriculture’s
						Empowering Rural America (New ERA) Program. This program has been the most significant federal
						funding for
						rural electric cooperatives since 1936 and will help to further our investments to meet growing
						energy
						demand and improve the reliability and resiliency of our system.
					</p>
					<p>
						The program, designed to help rural cooperatives implement reliable and affordable energy
						transitions, will support the building of new energy projects and some
						transmission, as well as the
						retirement of outdated sites. These projects will fight high energy costs and help our members
						reach 70%
						clean energy used in 2030, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 5.8 million tons
						annually.
					</p>
					<p>
						As part of the New ERA Program, we’re also investing in rural communities and offering community
						support,
						delivering on our commitment to our communities and those hosting our energy projects.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Electric Resource Planning</h3>
					<p>
						Our Electric Resource Plan (ERP) is central to our work to serve our members and meet our
						regulatory
						requirements as we pursue various energy investments. The process includes engagement and
						collaboration with
						our members and numerous stakeholders to ensure reliable, affordable, and responsible power for
						our members.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following <a href="https://tristate.coop/co-regulators-approve-ERP-settlement"
							class="underline">regulatory
							approval of our Phase I ERP</a> from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, we’ve now
						initiated Phase
						II, beginning with the procurement process for new resources. It will lead to over an 80%
						reduction in our
						greenhouse gas emissions in Colorado and 70% clean energy used by our members systemwide by
						2030. Phase II
						also includes landmark direct financial assistance to the communities of Craig and Moffat
						County, supporting
						their economic viability in light of coal plant closures.

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Wildfire Mitigation</h3>
					<p>
						High temperatures and dry conditions across our service area make the region susceptible to
						wildfires. To
						protect the people and ecosystems we serve and provide reliable energy, Tri-State has developed
						an approach
						focusing on situational awareness. We’re using tools like drones and weather monitoring to
						analyze risk
						reduction and are in constant communication with land managers, fire districts, and other
						utilities to
						properly assess and manage risk. The data we collect allows us to better understand the breadth
						of
						challenges posed by wildfires. We’re working hard to reduce risk through an average of 3,500
						man-hours per
						year in vegetation management and clearing. To complement our regional efforts, our staff
						regularly
						coordinates with federal agencies. We are also uniquely positioned to have ongoing wildfire
						mitigation
						conversations with relevant agencies and industry partners through the Electricity Subsector
						Coordinating
						Council (ESCC) Wildfire Working Group.

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Workplace Safety</h3>
					<p>
						Safety is our core value, and we put the safety of our employees, contractors, and communities
						above all
						else. We are committed to shaping a culture of safety, where every worker is encouraged to share
						safety
						tips, close calls, stories, and knowledge in and out of meetings to improve our collective
						well-being. We
						believe that safety is built through relationships, and we encourage our employees to take care
						of one
						another and maintain good communication. We reinforce our commitment to safety in ways big and
						small. This
						includes providing personal protective equipment, access to continuing safety education,
						trainings and
						certifications, and encouraging a standard of incident reporting to improve our safety.
						Tri-State recognizes
						that some jobs at our electric cooperative come with more risk than others, which is why we
						recognize those
						in high-risk roles and provide hazard rate pay. Tri-State’s leaders set the safety example, and
						field-trained safety personnel are on site at all times with employees. This year alone, two
						coal sites in
						Colorado reached 12 and 13 years respectively without having any serious injury, and three
						employees
						received awards from the Colorado Mining Association for 30 years without injury.

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Community Engagement/Charitable Giving</h3>
					<p>
						Tri-State is committed to giving back to the rural communities in which we operate. We support
						community
						organizations and charities like 4-H, Cooperative Family Fund, Future Farmers of America, and
						other
						rural-focused groups across Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming. We also encourage our
						employees to
						give back. In 2024, Tri-State employees volunteered in their communities for a total of 456
						hours. Employees
						have the flexibility to choose which organizations they would like to support, allowing them to
						participate
						in the causes they find most impactful to their communities. Additionally, Tri-State has
						supported our
						employee efforts by matching employee donations to non-profit organizations of their choosing.
						Most
						recently, employees and Tri-State donated over $246,000 to 73 chosen charities, bettering
						communities across
						the Western states.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Consumer Programs</h3>
					<p>
						Tri-State's commitment to affordability extends beyond the grid. Our On-Bill Repayment program
						aims to make
						energy efficiency and electrification updates more accessible for everyone by working with our
						members to
						offer consumers financing for home efficiency upgrades that require no money down, no credit
						check, and can
						be paid back over time through monthly electricity bills. The program offers low interest rates
						that won’t
						exceed more than 5% of the original fee. Tri-State members and consumers also have access to an
						energy
						efficient ecosystem that includes rebates, financing, equipment, education, and trustworthy
						contractors who
						help to complete efficiency upgrades, with the goal of reducing emissions and consumer energy
						costs.

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Cooperative Governance</h3>
					<p>
						Tri-State’s cooperative model and member-led governance structure differentiates us from other
						for-profit
						corporate utilities. We’re proud to say that our 43 member-owners and board of representatives,
						appointed by
						40 distribution utility members, have a seat at the table. The Board determines business
						decisions, sets
						priorities, makes policy decisions, and guides strategic planning for Tri-State initiatives,
						offering each
						utility member the opportunity to bring their unique voices to the forefront. Tri-State truly
						operates by
						the people and for the people, bringing transparency to our governance and giving everyone a
						platform to
						make their voices heard.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-8 font-serif font-light text-lg">Flexibility/BYOR</h3>
					<p>
						Our Bring Your Own Resource program provides flexibility to Tri-State members. The program
						allows them to
						develop their own projects that reflect the unique advantages and needs and keep consumer costs
						low in their
						service area. Recently accepted by federal regulators, projects are independently evaluated to
						meet
						reliability, economic, and environmental criteria. We expect that many future projects in the
						program will
						use renewable energy sources, continuing our commitment to achieving 50% renewable energy usage
						by our
						members in 2025, with a goal of 70% by 2030.
