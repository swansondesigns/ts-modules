					1936 and will help to further our investments to meet growing energy demand and improve the

					of our system.</p>

				<p><strong>The program, designed to help rural cooperatives implement reliable and affordable

						building of new energy projects as well as the retirement of outdated sites.</strong>
					These projects will fight high energy costs

				<p>
					High temperatures and dry conditions across our service area makes the region susceptible to
					wildfires. To protect the people and ecosystems we serve and provide reliable energy,
					Tri-State has developed an approach that focuses on situational awareness. We're using tools
					like drones and weather monitoring to analyze risk reduction and are in constant
					communication with land managers, fire districts and other utilities to properly assess and
					manage risk. The data we collect allows us to better understand the breadth of challenges
					posed by wildfires and we're working hard to reduce risk through an average of 3,500
					man-hours per year in vegetation management and clearing.
				</p>
				<p>
					To complement our regional efforts, our staff regularly coordinates with federal agencies.
					We are also uniquely positioned to have ongoing wildfire mitigation conversations with
					relevant agencies and industry partners through the Electricity Subsector Coordinating
					Council (ESCC) Wildfire Working Group.

						Safety is our core value, and we put the safety of our employees, contractors and
						communities above all else. We are committed to shaping a culture of safety, where every
						worker is encouraged to share safety tips, close calls, stories and knowledge in and out of
						meetings to improve our collective well-being. We believe that safety is built through
						relationships and encourage our employees to take care of one another and maintain good
						communication.
					</p>
					<p>
						We reinforce our commitment to safety in ways big and small, including providing personal
						protective equipment, access to continuing safety education, trainings and certifications,
						and encouraging a standard of incident reporting to improve our safety. Tri-State recognizes
						that some jobs at our electric cooperative come with more risk than others, which is why we
						recognize those in high-risk roles and provide hazard rate pay. Tri-State's leaders set the
						safety example and field-trained safety personnel are on site at all times with employees.
						This year alone, two coal sites in Colorado reached 12 and 13 years respectively without
						having a serious injury, and three employees received awards from the Colorado Mining
						Association for 30 years without injury.
